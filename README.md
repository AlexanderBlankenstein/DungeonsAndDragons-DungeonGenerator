# Dungeons And Dragons 1st Edition - Dungeon Generator

Using Appendix A from the 1st Edition D&D books, I set out to create a dungeon generation tool to help DM's run a game. 
This project uses Ant, Java, and JavaDocs to help develop and deploy this program. 
JUnit tests and checkstyles are used to ensure greate coding practices and also to allow me to learn those tools. 

I set out by working on 4 major milestones, documenting my progress along the way. 
This project origionally started when I was in school, I hope to further it in the future.
