Ant is a build system, similar to make. 
Checkstyle is a free linter and style checker for java.  I used the sun coding style for this project.

Learning Objectives:
- Independently learn about a domain to create a progam that is true to the domain requirements.
- create a java program that demonstrates proper message passing, object creation and interaction with users
- explore the use of version control software through use of git as the assignment submission mechanism
broaden experience with build tools by using ant

Project Task:
ï»¿- Create a command-line java program to help a dungeon master generate a description for a room in a dungeon. The program uses the jar file provided in the lib/ folder.

The generation process is from the Dungeon Masters Guide to the First Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons. Appendix A from that book. 
Documentation on how the Dungeon needs to be built off of can be found within the Doc.

The following user stories were used for my program creation:
As a dungeon master I want to:

- randomly generate treasure
- select specific treasure (by providing the specific table roll)
- randomly generate the size and shape of a chamber
- select a specific size and shape for a chamber (by providing the specific table roll)
- randomly generate the contents of a chamber
- select specific contents for the chamber (by providing the specific table roll)
- randomly generate an entire chamber
- generate a complete room step by step while choosing random or specific generation for each element of the chamber
- print to screen a human-readable description for the chamber generated
